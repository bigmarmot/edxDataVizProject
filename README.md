***Section 2 Exercises***

My data story is to discover if students that have appear to have graduate degrees tend to have more experience in data visualization than the mean of the class. I found that it is quite the opposite. However, the flaw in this chart is that the data is not connected. So there is really no way to understand the actual distibution per student type.

I used Google spreadsheets and charts for the first time which was a rather frustrating experience. I attempted to use two stacked column charts, but could not get the serries to function properly. So, I simply created two seperate charts.
